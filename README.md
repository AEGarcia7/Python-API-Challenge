# Python-API-Challenge

## Description:
Whether financial, political, or social&mdash;data's true power rests in its ability to answer questions definitively. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

But, if pressed, how would you **prove** it?

## Data Used:
cities.csv

## Technologies:
Jupyter notebook, Pandas, MatPlotLib, Scipy, Numpy, json, Google API, Time, Requests
